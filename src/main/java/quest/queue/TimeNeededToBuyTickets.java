/**
 * There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person is at the front of the line and the (n - 1)th person is at the back of the line.
 * <p>
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n where the number of tickets that the ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].
 * <p>
 * Each person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.
 * <p>
 * Return the time taken for the person initially at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
 * <p>
 * Output: 6
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * <p>
 * The queue starts as [2,3,2], where the kth person is underlined.
 * After the person at the front has bought a ticket, the queue becomes [3,2,1] at 1 second.
 * Continuing this process, the queue becomes [2,1,2] at 2 seconds.
 * Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1,2,1] at 3 seconds.
 * Continuing this process, the queue becomes [2,1] at 4 seconds. Note: the person at the front left the queue.
 * Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1,1] at 5 seconds.
 * Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1] at 6 seconds. The kth person has bought all their tickets, so return 6.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0
 * <p>
 * Output: 8
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * <p>
 * The queue starts as [5,1,1,1], where the kth person is underlined.
 * After the person at the front has bought a ticket, the queue becomes [1,1,1,4] at 1 second.
 * Continuing this process for 3 seconds, the queue becomes [4] at 4 seconds.
 * Continuing this process for 4 seconds, the queue becomes [] at 8 seconds. The kth person has bought all their tickets, so return 8.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * n == tickets.length
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 1 <= tickets[i] <= 100
 * 0 <= k < n

    /*
    Deeper Insight (Greedy Observation)
        Instead of simulating every second, think:
        How many times does each person get a chance to buy?
        For person k:
            They need tickets[k] turns
        For others:
            If they are before or at k, they can buy up to tickets[k] times
            If they are after k, they get one less chance
